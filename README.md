# torch-hacker

exploring how to make models that are fast and easily to use on:

- replicate / cuda
- apple silicon

## status

- [x] outer model that can be used on replicate

## todo

- [ ] how to use use on macos
- [ ] support file inputs (whisper, llava, etc)
- [ ] how to "compile" an optimized cog on replicate
- [ ] support models that leverage github code bases (example [moondream](https://github.com/vikhyat/moondream))
- [ ] "vibe" tests for input/outputs?
- [ ] "streaming" support
- [ ] support non-torch models

## models

- [ ] blip
- [ ] blip-2
- [ ] codeformer
- [ ] esrgan
- [ ] gfpgan
- [ ] LCM
- [ ] llava
- [ ] moondream
- [ ] photomaker
- [ ] instant-id
- [ ] i2vgen-xl
